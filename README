pr-tracker
==========

Run a web server that displays the path a Nixpkgs pull request will
take through the various release channels.  An instance is available
at the time of writing at <https://nixpk.gs/pr-tracker.html>.


Installation
------------

Build and runtime dependencies:
 - libsystemd
 - OpenSSL

Other build dependencies:
 - Cargo
 - rustc
 - pkg-config

Other runtime dependencies:
 - Git

In most cases, installation should be as simple as

	make install


Usage
-----

The program must be supplied with a local checkout of the monitored
git repository, the remote name in the repository corresponding to
upstream Nixpkgs, a User-Agent string to use when contacting the
GitHub API, and a URL where users can download the program's source
code.  Optionally, a "mount" path can be specified, which will be
prefixed to all of the server's routes, so that it can be served at a
non-root HTTP path.

For example:

	pr-tracker \
		--path /var/lib/nixpkgs.git \
		--remote nixpkgs \
		--user-agent 'pr-tracker (alyssais)' \
		--source-url https://example.com/pr-tracker.tar.gz \
		--mount pr-tracker

Additionally, a GitHub API token should be supplied on pr-tracker's
standard input.

pr-tracker expects the socket(s) for it to listen on to be set up for
it by a service supervisor, using the systemd socket activation
protocol.  It does not support binding its own sockets.  To run
outside of a systemd unit, you can use systemd-socket-activate:

	systemd-socket-activate -l 0.0.0.0:8000 pr-tracker [...]

Further information on available command line arguments can be
obtained with

	pr-tracker --help
